    <p> Poets love possibility! They love to wonder and explore. Hard lot! 
        But the poem, no matter how 
        
        <span>full of possibility,</span>
        
        has to exist! To conduct oneself, to behave. How a poem acts marks 
        its individual character.

        A poem by Glandolyn Blue does not sound like a poem by 
        Timothy Sure. to pretend, feign, impersonate. That, too, yes and 
        always, because self-consciousness is its own pretension, and has 
        been from its beginning; the human mind is capable of a 

        <span>great elastic theatre.</span>

        Everyone knows that if you query poets about how their poems begin, 
        the answer is always the same: a phrase, a line, a scrap of language, 
        a rhythm, an image, something seen, heard, witnessed, or imagined.
         And the lesson is always the same, and young poets recognize this 
         to be one of the most important lessons they can learn: if you have 
         any idea for a poem, an exact grid of intent, you are on the wrong 
         path, a dead-end alley, at the top of a cliff you havenâ€™t even climbed. 
         This is a lesson that can only be learned by trial and error. 

         theater requires that you draw a circle around the action and observe it 
         from 
         
        <span>outside the circle</span>
         
         
         ; in other words, self-consciousness is theatre. </p>
