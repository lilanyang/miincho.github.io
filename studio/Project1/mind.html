        I believe the poem is an act of the mind. 
        I think it is easier to talk about the end 
        of a poem than it is to talk about its 
        beginning. Because 
        
        <span class="bold">
            the poem 
        </span>

        ends on the page, but it begins off the page, it 
        
        <span class="bold">
            begins in the mind.
        </span>
        
        The mind acts, the mind wills a 
        poem, often against our own will; somehow 
        this happens, somehow a poem gets written 
        in the middle of a chaotic holiday party 
        that has just run out of ice, and it's your house.Â 
        An act of the mind. To move, to make happen, 
        to make manifest. Be an act of Congress. 
        
        <span class="bold">
            A state of real existence 
        </span>
        
        
        rather than possibility.
