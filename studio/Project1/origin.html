        Bachelard’s sentence simply says this: 
        
        <a href="originpop.html" 
            onclick="positionedPopup(this.href,'myWindow','450','445','50%','50%','yes');return false"> origins
        </a>
        
        (beginnings) have consequences (endings). <br><br>
        The poem is the consequence of its 
        
        
        <a href="originpop.html" 
            onclick="positionedPopup(this.href,'myWindow','450','445','50%','50%','yes');return false"> origins.
        </a>
        
        Give me the fruit and I will take from it a 
        see and plant it and watch grow the tree from which it fell. 
        Barbara Henstein Smith, in her book Poetic Closure: A Study of How Poems End, says this:
        “Perhaps all we can say, and even this may be too much, is that varying degrees or states
        of tension seem to be involved in all our experiences, and that the most gratifying ones
        are those in which whatever tensions are created are also released. Or, to use another 
        familiar set of terms, an experience is gratifying to the extent that those expectations 
        that are aroused are also fulfilled.” <br><br>
        But there is no book I know of on the subject of how poems begin. How can the 
        
        <a href="originpop.html" 
            onclick="positionedPopup(this.href,'myWindow','450','445','50%','50%','yes');return false"> origins
        </a> 
        
        be traced when there is no form or shape that precedes it to trace? It is exactly like 
        tracing the moment of the big bang—we can go back to a nanosecond before the beginning, 
        before the universe burst into being, but we can’t go back to the precise beginning 
        because that would precede knowledge, and we can’t “know” anything before “knowing” itself was born.
