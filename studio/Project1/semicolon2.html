                The mind acts, the mind wills a poem, often against our own will <span>;</span>
                somehow this happens, somehow a poem gets written in the middle 
                of a chaotic holiday party that has just run out of ice, and 
                it's your house. 
                
                A poem by Glandolyn Blue does not sound like a poem by Timothy Sure. 
                to pretend, feign, impersonate. That, too, yes and always, because 
                self-consciousness is its own pretension, and has been from its beginning<span>;</span> 
                the human mind is capable of a great elastic theatre. As the poet Ralph 
                angel puts it, “The poem is an interpretation of weird theatrical shit.” 
                the weird theatrical shit is what goes on around us every day of our lives<span>;</span> 
                an animal of only instinct, Johnny Ferret, has in his actions drama, 
                but no theater<span>;</span> theater requires that you draw a circle around the action 
                and observe it from outside the circle<span>;</span> in other words, self-consciousness is theatre. 
        
                When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, he said: “That’s a lot of 
                semicolons!” he is absolutely right<span>;</span> the sentence would be unwieldy and 
                awkward and resemble the novel of a savant, but the next time you use a 
                semicolon (which, by the way, is the least-used mark of punctuation in 
                all of poetry) you should stop and be thankful that there exists this 
                little thing, invented by a human being—an Italian as a matter of fact—that 
                allows us to go on and keep on connecting speech that for all apparent 
                purposes is unrelated. 
        
                Gaston Bachelard says the single most succinct and astonishing thing: 
                We begin in admiration and we end by organizing our disappointment. 
                The moment of admiration is the experience of something unfiltered, 
                vital and fresh—it could also be horror—and the moment of organization 
                is both the onset of disappointment and its dignification<span>;</span> the least we 
                can do is dignify our knowingness, the loss of some vitality through 
                familiarization, by admiring not the thing itself but how we can organize 
                it, think about it.
