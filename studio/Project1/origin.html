        Bachelard’s sentence simply says this: 
        
        <a href="originpop.html" 
            onclick="positionedPopup(this.href,'pull down','450','445','50%','50%','yes');return false"> origins
        </a>
        
        (beginnings) have consequences (endings). <br><br>
        The poem is the consequence of its 
        
        
        <a href="originpop.html" 
            onclick="positionedPopup(this.href,'myWindow','450','445','50%','50%','yes');return false"> origins.
        </a>
        
        Give me the fruit and I will take from it a 
        see and plant it and watch grow the tree from which it fell. 
        Barbara Henstein Smith, in her book Poetic Closure: A Study of How Poems End, says this:
        “Perhaps all we can say, and even this may be too much, is that varying degrees or states
        of tension seem to be involved in all our experiences, and that the most gratifying ones
        are those in which whatever tensions are created are also released. Or, to use another 
        familiar set of terms, an experience is gratifying to the extent that those expectations 
        that are aroused are also fulfilled.” <br><br>
